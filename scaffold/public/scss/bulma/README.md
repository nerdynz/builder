# bulma-scss

This is a port of the [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) project SASS
files to the SCSS syntax.

Currently, these files are based on Bulma version 0.7.1, and will be updated
with later releases. The files are converted to SCSS with
[this script](https://gist.github.com/j1mc/ff1ff83e277b1e221761fc0c0ee3b164).
